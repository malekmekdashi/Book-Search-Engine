  ## Description
  This project allows a user to create an account, login, and add a list of books the user chooses to their profile page. When one searches a book, they are presented with a page that loads the books with a summary included. When logged in, the use can save the book to their profile. We first begin this application by installing the packages using "npm install" and from there we begin the development. once finished, we run "npm run develop" and we are taken to the localhost to view the website. I also deleted the controllers folder because it is not needed in this application becasue it is a MERN application.
